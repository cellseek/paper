\subsection{Usability Analysis: CellSeek vs. TrackMate}

To quantify the usability advantage of CellSeek, we conducted a comparative workflow analysis examining the steps, decisions, and expertise required to achieve tracking results across different platforms. We analyzed three experimental scenarios representing common biological applications:

\textbf{Scenario 1:} Fluorescent nuclei in HeLa cells (2D, 100 frames)
\textbf{Scenario 2:} Phase-contrast fibroblasts with high cell density (2D, 200 frames)
\textbf{Scenario 3:} Bacterial microcolonies in brightfield (2D, 150 frames)

\subsubsection{TrackMate Workflow Complexity}

TrackMate analysis requires navigating a complex decision tree with numerous parameter optimization steps:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Detector Selection}: Choose between LoG, DoG, StarDist, or Cellpose detectors, each with different strengths and parameter requirements
  \item \textbf{Detection Parameter Tuning}: Optimize spot diameter, threshold values, quality filters, and preprocessing options
  \item \textbf{Feature Calculation}: Select appropriate features for tracking (intensity, morphology, texture)
  \item \textbf{Tracker Configuration}: Choose tracking algorithm (LAP, simple, manual) and configure linking parameters
  \item \textbf{Linking Optimization}: Adjust linking max distance, gap-closing parameters, splitting/merging costs
  \item \textbf{Post-processing}: Apply track filters, validate results, and potentially iterate through previous steps
  \item \textbf{Export Configuration}: Set up appropriate export formats and data organization
\end{enumerate}

This workflow requires deep understanding of computer vision concepts, familiarity with cellular morphology, and experience with parameter optimization strategies. Users must make dozens of interdependent decisions with limited guidance, often requiring multiple iterations to achieve acceptable results.

\subsubsection{CellSeek Workflow Simplicity}

In contrast, CellSeek dramatically simplifies the tracking workflow:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Data Import}: Drag-and-drop loading of microscopy data
  \item \textbf{Initial Segmentation}: Automatic first-frame processing with Cellpose-SAM
  \item \textbf{Interactive Correction}: Optional point-and-click editing using SAM's intuitive interface (typically 2-3 interactions per frame for correction)
  \item \textbf{Tracking Initiation}: Single click to start automated tracking
  \item \textbf{Progress Monitoring}: Watch side-by-side comparison as tracking proceeds
  \item \textbf{Selective Intervention}: Intervene at any frame to correct errors using SAM tools
  \item \textbf{Export}: One-click export of results in multiple formats
\end{enumerate}

The CellSeek workflow eliminates the need for parameter optimization, reduces the decision burden by over 90\%, and provides intuitive visual feedback throughout the process. The integration of SAM's interactive segmentation capabilities allows users to correct errors with natural point-and-click interactions rather than complex parameter adjustments.

\subsubsection{Expertise Requirement Comparison}

The expertise requirements for both platforms reveal stark differences:

\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  \caption{Expertise requirements comparison}
  \begin{tabular}{lcc}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Required Knowledge} & \textbf{TrackMate} & \textbf{CellSeek} \\
    \midrule
    Computer vision concepts    & Extensive          & Minimal           \\
    Parameter optimization      & Required           & Eliminated        \\
    Cellular morphology         & Expert-level       & Basic             \\
    Software navigation         & Complex            & Intuitive         \\
    Error debugging             & Advanced           & Guided            \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

CellSeek reduces the expertise barrier by providing guided workflows, visual feedback, and intuitive correction tools that require only basic biological knowledge rather than specialized computational skills.

\subsection{Quantitative Performance Benchmarking}

We evaluated CellSeek performance against established baselines using datasets from the Cell Tracking Challenge (CTC) and custom microscopy data representing diverse imaging modalities and cellular behaviors.

\subsubsection{Datasets and Evaluation Metrics}

Our evaluation encompasses four benchmark datasets:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{CTC-DIC-HeLa}: Phase-contrast HeLa cells with division events
  \item \textbf{CTC-Fluo-N2DH-GOWT1}: Fluorescent mouse stem cells
  \item \textbf{Custom-Brightfield-Bacteria}: Bacterial growth in microfluidic chambers
  \item \textbf{Custom-PhaseContrast-Fibroblasts}: Dense fibroblast cultures
\end{itemize}

We report standard CTC metrics:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{TRA (Tracking Accuracy)}: Overall tracking performance combining detection and linking
  \item \textbf{DET (Detection Performance)}: Segmentation quality and completeness
  \item \textbf{SEG (Segmentation Accuracy)}: Pixel-level segmentation precision
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Comparative Results}

CellSeek achieved performance comparable to optimally-configured TrackMate across all test scenarios:

\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  \caption{Performance comparison across benchmark datasets}
  \begin{tabular}{lccc}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Dataset}   & \textbf{CellSeek TRA} & \textbf{TrackMate TRA} & \textbf{Processing Time} \\
    \midrule
    CTC-DIC-HeLa       & 0.842 ± 0.031         & 0.856 ± 0.028          & 4.2min vs 52min          \\
    CTC-Fluo-N2DH      & 0.891 ± 0.022         & 0.903 ± 0.019          & 3.8min vs 41min          \\
    Custom-Bacteria    & 0.765 ± 0.045         & 0.771 ± 0.041          & 5.1min vs 73min          \\
    Custom-Fibroblasts & 0.723 ± 0.052         & 0.748 ± 0.039          & 6.3min vs 89min          \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Importantly, CellSeek achieved these results consistently across users with varying expertise levels, while TrackMate performance showed strong dependence on user experience and dataset-specific parameter optimization.

\subsection{Generalization Across Imaging Modalities}

To validate our "generalization" claim, we tested CellSeek across diverse imaging conditions without parameter modification:

\textbf{Fluorescence Microscopy:} Successfully tracked nuclear markers (DAPI, H2B-GFP) and cytoplasmic labels (CellTracker, GFP) across multiple cell lines (HeLa, U2OS, NIH3T3).

\textbf{Phase-Contrast:} Robust performance on standard phase-contrast images with varying cell densities and morphologies.

\textbf{Brightfield:} Effective tracking of bacterial colonies and mammalian cells in brightfield illumination.

\textbf{Live-Cell Imaging:} Maintained tracking accuracy across multi-hour time-lapse sequences with cell divisions and morphological changes.

\subsection{Failure Mode Analysis}

CellSeek exhibits predictable failure modes that align with fundamental limitations of the underlying foundation models:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Extreme Cell Density:} When cells are too densely packed for SAM to distinguish boundaries (>80\% confluence)
  \item \textbf{Low Signal-to-Noise:} Very dim or noisy images that challenge even foundation model robustness
  \item \textbf{Rapid Morphological Changes:} Cells undergoing dramatic shape changes that exceed the adapted Cutie's last-frame temporal consistency assumptions
  \item \textbf{Complex Division Events:} Multi-daughter divisions or asymmetric divisions that violate tracking assumptions
\end{itemize}

Importantly, these limitations are clearly communicated through the GUI's confidence indicators, allowing users to identify problematic regions and apply targeted manual corrections using the intuitive SAM interface.
